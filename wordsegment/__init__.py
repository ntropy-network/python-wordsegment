"""English Word Segmentation in Python

Word segmentation is the process of dividing a phrase without spaces back
into its constituent parts. For example, consider a phrase like "thisisatest".
For humans, it's relatively easy to parse. This module makes it easy for
machines too. Use `segment` to parse a phrase into its parts:

>>> from wordsegment import load, segment
>>> load()
>>> segment('thisisatest')
['this', 'is', 'a', 'test']

In the code, 1024908267229 is the total number of words in the corpus. A
subset of this corpus is found in unigrams.txt and bigrams.txt which
should accompany this file. A copy of these files may be found at
http://norvig.com/ngrams/ under the names count_1w.txt and count_2w.txt
respectively.
